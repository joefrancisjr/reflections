What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Initializing a new repository places the files needed for git to log commit history. You need to do this if you intend to commit changes for tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area places a version of your file in a holding place to save to your commit. This is different than the working directory as it is only saving info from the time it was placed in the staging area, not after.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  Using the staging area ensures you have one commit per logical change, as you choose the files to add after the change has been completed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

  Branches can be helpful if you are trying new features or possibly if you are collaborating on a project.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  Using the diagrams allows you to see the order in which commits are created and what branch they belong under. This would be useful as projects grow and become more complicated.
